## ⚡ About Nexus

Nexus is the core technical club under the **SSOSC** ecosystem at Srinivas Institute of Technology, Mangalore. We are not just a club; we are a community of builders, shippers, and open-source enthusiasts.

We exist to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry-grade engineering. If you are here to build, break things, and fix them faster, you are in the right place.

## 🛠 What We Do

We don't do "seminars." We do **shipping**.

- **Open Source Projects:** Building tools and utilities for the SIT student body.
- **Full Stack Development:** Specialized focus on the MERN stack, Next.js, and TypeScript.
- **DevOps & Automation:** Implementing CI/CD pipelines, Dockerizing apps, and automating workflows with n8n.
- **Hackathons:** Hosting and dominating inter-college coding competitions.

## 🔥 Daily Tech Jams

**Debugging. Co-working. Shipping.**

The heartbeat of Nexus is the **Daily Tech Jam**.
- **When:** Every evening (Check Discord for timings).
- **Where:** [Location/Discord Link]
- **Agenda:** No lectures. Bring your bugs, bring your projects, and let's solve them together.

## 🏗 Tech Stack

We are agnostic, but we have a heavy preference for modern, scalable tech:

| Domain | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express, Bun, Hono |
